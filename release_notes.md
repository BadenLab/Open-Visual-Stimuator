## Release notes

#### 2020-02-11
- We noticed that [EKB](https://www.ekbtechnologies.com/) recently changed their part numbers and that the part numbers are confusing. Therefore, some of the LCr related information given in [Table 2](https://elifesciences.org/articles/48779#table2) in Franke at al. (2019) is incorrect. Here is the (currently) correct ordering information:

    1) Follow this [link](https://www.ekbtechnologies.com/e-store/dlp-lightcrafter-e4500-mkii-fiber-couple?c=5cb86ca038d9a) to        find the 0.45' â€˜DLP Fiber couple E4500MKII Development Module.
    2) **Important: For the solution we decribe in the paper, make sure that you selected the fiber type "LLG" (for Thorlab's light guide).**
    3) Note that the part number still seems `DPM-E4500MKIIFC` - which is a bit confusing. Therefore make sure that EKB knows what fibre adapter you need.

#### 2019-10-04
- Added a new folder ([`/printed_parts/optical_components/lcr_addons`](https://github.com/eulerlab/open-visual-stimulator/tree/master/printed_parts/optical_components/lcr_addons)) for additional parts provided by users.
- New mechanical part to couple a light guide into an LED port of a "standard" lighcrafter (`fibre_coupler`). Contributed by David Ide, Biomedical Engineering Technician, NIMH Section on Instrumentation.
