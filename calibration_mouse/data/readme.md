`LEDs_Setup2_20180821` - Measurement of the intensity curve (128 levels, from 0 to 255 in steps of 2) for the UV and the 
green LED to estimate the gamma correction look-up table (LUT, `defaultGammaLUT.txt`). Note that LED power was increased 
compare to the normal experimental conditions (i.e. retina recordings) to yield spectrometer readings in the low level range. 

`LEDs_Setup2_20180823` - Measurement of the intensity curve (128 levels, from 0 to 255 in steps of 2) for the UV and the 
green LED **with gamma-correction** applied. Note that like for `LEDs_Setup2_20180821`, LED power was increased 
compare to the normal experimental conditions to yield spectrometer readings in the low level range. 

`LEDs_Setup2_20190130` - Measurement of maximal intensity (only level 255) of the UV and the green LED **after adjusting 
the LED power** to the range used for retina recordings. 

`TFTMonitor_Samsung_4` - Measurement of a random TFT monitor.
